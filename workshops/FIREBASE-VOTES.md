# Firebase Votes

> __Be sure to set up your credentials in [the Firebase config](../src/config.json). This is required before doing any other work.__

- Get the total votes from Firebase (this should be ok on master)
- Display these votes per id. You could use something like VictoryCharts' bar chart: https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-bar/
- Display a toast whenever someone votes using a lib or custom component like https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify (you may have to share your url with someone on the network or open another tab/window)
